# Phase 3: IPO Analysis

**Goal**: Document every callable unit in the source project using the IPO framework
(Input → Process → Output). This registry becomes the specification that Phase 4 translates from.

The IPO registry is the single source of truth for "what the source code does".
Phase 4 must not read the source code directly — it must translate from the IPO registry.
This separation ensures that structural equivalence is maintained, not incidentally achieved.

## ⛔ ABSOLUTE PROHIBITION: No Batch Script Generation

**The following is strictly forbidden and constitutes task fraud:**

- Using any script, loop, or template to batch-generate content fields in `ipo-registry.yaml`
- Copying the same `process.steps`, `purpose`, or `notes` text across multiple functions
- Filling `magic_numbers`, `inferred_invariants`, or `side_effects` without reading the actual source
- Marking any function `translation_status: DONE` in P3 (P3 only sets up registry; translation is P4)

**Scripts are ONLY permitted for generating the empty skeleton** (id, source_file, signature, source_lines).
Every content field — steps, magic_numbers, invariants, side_effects, calls, outputs — MUST be
filled by the AI after physically reading the source file for that specific function.

The AI must treat each function as a unique, isolated analysis task.

---

## Anti-Cheating Protocol: Mandatory READ_EVIDENCE

Every IPO entry must be preceded by a `READ_EVIDENCE` block in the AI's response.
This block contains artifacts that can ONLY be produced by actually reading the source.

**Before filling any IPO entry, output this in the response (not stored in YAML):**

```
READ_EVIDENCE for <function_id>:
  file_read: "<source_file>:<start_line>-<end_line>"
  first_statement: "<exact text of the first executable line in the function body>"
  last_statement:  "<exact text of the last executable line>"
  literal_count:   <number of numeric/string literals in the body>
  call_count:      <number of distinct function/method calls made>
  branch_count:    <number of if/elif/else/for/while/try/except branches>
```

If the AI cannot produce this block with accurate values, it has not read the file.
**Do not proceed to fill the IPO entry without outputting READ_EVIDENCE first.**

This acts as a reading receipt. A fabricated block will produce wrong line numbers,
wrong literal counts, or wrong statement text — detectable during P5 verification.

---

## Anti-Cheating Protocol: Mandatory BEHAVIOR_PROOF

After filling each IPO entry, the AI must output a `BEHAVIOR_PROOF` block:

```
BEHAVIOR_PROOF for <function_id>:
  happy_path:   "Given <specific concrete input>, returns/does <specific concrete output>"
  edge_case_1:  "Given <boundary input>, the function <raises X / returns Y / does Z>"
  edge_case_2:  "Given <another boundary>, <specific behavior>"
  would_fail_if: "<specific condition that violates an inferred invariant>"
```

Values must be SPECIFIC and CONCRETE — no generic statements.

❌ BAD (proves nothing — could be fabricated):
```
happy_path: "Given valid input, returns the expected result"
```

✅ GOOD (proves understanding — cannot be fabricated without reading):
```
happy_path: "Given data=[0.3, 0.3, 0.4] and base=2, returns 1.5710 (Shannon entropy in bits)"
edge_case_1: "Given data=[0.0, 1.0], filters 0.0 (below epsilon=1e-10), returns 0.0"
would_fail_if: "sum(data) >> 1.0 — inferred invariant violated, mathematically wrong output"
```

If the AI cannot write specific concrete values, it has not understood the function.
Block and re-read before continuing.

---

## Entry Criteria

- `phases.P2_ecosystem_map: DONE`
- `ecosystem-map.yaml` has no entries with `status: NEEDS_REVIEW` (every entry is `CONFIRMED` or `GAP_ACCEPTED`)
- `migration-state.yaml` has no `current_task.status: BLOCKED` (all human decisions from P2 resolved)

## Exit Criteria

- Every function in every `translate`-strategy source file has an entry in `ipo-registry.yaml`
- Every step has `source_lines` populated (not empty)
- Every magic number has `source_line` populated (not 0)
- Every inferred invariant has `[inferred from: ...]` evidence
- Self-verification report passed (see below)
- `phases.P3_ipo_analysis: DONE`, `phases.P4_translation: IN_PROGRESS`

---

## Execution Protocol: Sequential Per-Function Analysis

**Maximum: 500 functions per AI response.** No exceptions.
Each function is processed individually in sequence — READ_EVIDENCE → fill entry → BEHAVIOR_PROOF — before moving to the next. The batch size controls how many complete cycles fit in one response, not how many are processed in parallel.

For each function, execute this exact sequence — no steps skipped, no order changed:

```
Step A: Read the source file for this specific function
Step B: Output READ_EVIDENCE block in response
Step C: Fill IPO entry fields (steps, magic_numbers, invariants, side_effects, calls, outputs)
Step D: Output BEHAVIOR_PROOF block in response
Step E: Write updated entry to ipo-registry.yaml
Step F: Move to the next function
```

Steps B and D are not optional. They are the primary mechanism preventing task fraud.

## IPO Documentation Field Rules

### process.steps — source_lines is MANDATORY

Every step must include the line range that implements it:

```yaml
steps:
  - step: 1
    desc: "Filter probabilities below epsilon to avoid log(0)"
    source_lines: "45-47"        # MANDATORY — leave empty = task fraud
    magic_numbers:
      - value: 1e-10
        source_line: 46          # MANDATORY — exact line of the literal
        type: threshold
        purpose: "epsilon floor: probabilities below this treated as zero"
        origin: inferred_from_context
```

### ⛔ Branch Coverage: Every `if/elif/else/for/while/try/except` is a Separate Step

**The most common P3 failure**: a function with 4 branches is documented as 2 steps.
Every conditional branch path must appear as its own `step` entry with its own `source_lines`.

```yaml
# WRONG — collapses branches:
steps:
  - step: 1
    desc: "Handle turn-based callback logic"
    source_lines: "120-180"

# CORRECT — every branch is a step:
steps:
  - step: 1
    desc: "Every 65 turns, outside plan mode: trigger ask_user"
    source_lines: "122-128"
    magic_numbers:
      - value: 65
        source_line: 122
        type: iteration_limit
        purpose: "65-turn cadence prevents context exhaustion; NOT 50 (earlier draft value)"
        origin: inferred_from_context
  - step: 2
    desc: "In plan mode, every 5 turns (>=10): prompt to re-read plan file and confirm current step"
    source_lines: "130-138"
    magic_numbers:
      - value: 5
        source_line: 131
        type: iteration_limit
        purpose: "plan review cadence"
        origin: inferred_from_context
      - value: 10
        source_line: 130
        type: threshold
        purpose: "minimum turns before plan review starts"
        origin: inferred_from_context
  - step: 3
    desc: "In plan mode, over 90 turns: force ask_user regardless of cadence"
    source_lines: "140-145"
    magic_numbers:
      - value: 90
        source_line: 140
        type: iteration_limit
        purpose: "hard cap to prevent runaway plan execution"
        origin: inferred_from_context
```

**Branch count check**: After filling steps, count them. If `steps_count < branch_count` from READ_EVIDENCE, branches are collapsed. Re-read and expand.

### ⛔ Post-Construction Attribute Setting: Must Appear in Caller's side_effects

Python pattern:
```python
agent = startSubagent(config)
agent.inc_out = True      # line 47
agent.verbose = False     # line 48
```

These two lines are NOT part of `startSubagent`'s body — they appear in the **caller**.
They must be documented in the **caller's** `side_effects`:

```yaml
# In the CALLER's IPO entry:
side_effects:
  - "sets agent.inc_out = True on returned subagent [line 47]"
  - "sets agent.verbose = False on returned subagent [line 48]"
```

AND the `startSubagent` IPO must note this in `translation_notes`:
```yaml
translation_notes: "Caller is responsible for setting inc_out=True and verbose=False after construction. Verify caller's IPO side_effects include these assignments."
```

**Rule**: After documenting any function that returns an object, scan the call sites for post-construction assignments. Every assignment is a side effect of the call site.

### ⛔ Multi-Step Compound Processing: Each Processing Stage is a Separate Step

Python pattern:
```python
content = get_html(url, text_only=True)
if text_only:
    content = smart_format(content, maxlen // 3)   # secondary truncation
return content
```

The secondary truncation is a distinct processing step. It must NOT be merged with step 1:

```yaml
steps:
  - step: 1
    desc: "Fetch HTML content with text_only mode enabled"
    source_lines: "34-36"
  - step: 2
    desc: "If text_only: apply secondary truncation at maxlen//3 to reduce HTML noise"
    source_lines: "37-39"
    magic_numbers:
      - value: "maxlen // 3"
        source_line: 38
        type: threshold
        purpose: "secondary truncation cap: 1/3 of primary limit to aggressively strip HTML overhead"
        origin: inferred_from_context
```

**Rule**: Any `if condition: transform(x)` after a primary operation is a separate step. The condition is the step guard, the transform is the step body.

### magic_numbers — source_line is MANDATORY

For EVERY numeric or string literal (except 0, 1, -1 as loop increments):

```yaml
magic_numbers:
  - value: 1e-10
    source_line: 46           # mandatory — exact line number
    type: threshold
    purpose: "specific purpose — not 'a threshold value'"
    origin: inferred_from_context
```

`origin: unknown` = automatic BLOCK. Do not continue to next function until resolved.

### inferred_invariants — evidence bracket is MANDATORY

```yaml
inferred_invariants:
  - "caller guarantees sum(data) ≈ 1.0 [inferred from: no normalization in body + test fixtures always sum to 1.0]"
  - "input list non-empty [inferred from: line 43 divides by len(data) with no guard]"
```

The `[inferred from: ...]` bracket is mandatory. It proves the invariant was observed, not invented.

### side_effects — line references are MANDATORY

```yaml
side_effects:
  - "writes to file: {path_param}/output.csv [line 67]"
  - "mutates: self.cache (dict) [line 54]"
  - "reads env var: DATABASE_URL [line 23]"
```

### calls — must be populated by scanning function body

An empty `calls: []` is valid only for confirmed leaf functions.
Wrong `calls` list = broken topological order in P4 = structural errors downstream.

---

## Context Sources (Priority Order)

Before analyzing any function:

1. **The function itself** — code, inline comments (produces READ_EVIDENCE)
2. **Docstring / JSDoc / godoc** — formal documentation
3. **All files with `p3_required: true`** — algorithm notes, design documents
4. **Callers of this function** — what do they pass in?
5. **Test files that exercise this function** — reveal edge cases and expected behavior
6. **Git commit messages** (if accessible) — explain why the code is shaped this way

Never analyze a function in isolation.

---

## Execution Order

Topological sort by `calls` graph — leaf functions first, callers after callees.
This ensures that when documenting a caller, all callees are already understood.

---

## P3 Self-Verification Protocol

**Before marking P3 DONE**, the AI must run and report all three checks:

### Check 1: source_lines Coverage Scan

Scan every entry in ipo-registry.yaml:
- Count entries where ANY step has empty `source_lines`
- Count magic_numbers where `source_line` is 0 or empty

```
CHECK 1 RESULT:
  total_functions: <N>
  steps_missing_source_lines: <X>   ← must be 0
  magic_numbers_missing_source_line: <Y>   ← must be 0
  action: <re-analyzed X functions / none required>
```

### Check 2: Invariant Evidence Scan

Scan every `inferred_invariants` entry:
- Count entries missing `[inferred from: ...]` bracket

```
CHECK 2 RESULT:
  invariants_missing_evidence: <X>   ← must be 0
  action: <re-analyzed X functions / none required>
```

### Check 3: Spot-Check Recall Test

Randomly select 5 functions. Without re-reading source, write BEHAVIOR_PROOF for each from memory.
If any answer is vague/generic, those functions must be re-analyzed.

```
CHECK 3 RESULT:
  spot_check_functions: [fn1, fn2, fn3, fn4, fn5]
  fn1_happy_path: "<specific concrete value>"
  fn2_happy_path: "<specific concrete value>"
  fn3_happy_path: "<specific concrete value>"
  fn4_happy_path: "<specific concrete value>"
  fn5_happy_path: "<specific concrete value>"
  spot_check_result: PASS / FAIL
  action: <re-analyzed X functions / none required>
```

**All three checks must pass before `phases.P3_ipo_analysis` is set to DONE.**
The self-verification report must appear in the AI's response — not silently in YAML.

## Phase Exit: Trigger PGR-3

When you believe P3 is complete, do NOT mark it DONE yet.

Load `references/phase-gate-review.md` and run PGR-3 using the audit criteria defined there.
Only set `phases.P3_ipo_analysis: DONE` after PGR-3 passes with zero findings.

The PGR-3 loop will:
1. Verify every function from translate-strategy files is in `ipo-registry.yaml` (or explicitly marked SKIP)
2. Verify every entry has at least one process step with non-empty `source_lines`
3. Verify every magic number has a non-zero `source_line`
4. Verify every `inferred_invariant` contains the `[inferred from: ...]` evidence bracket
5. Verify no entry has `translation_status: DONE` (translation happens in P4, not P3)
6. Verify branch coverage: for every entry, `steps_count >= READ_EVIDENCE.branch_count`; flag any entry where branches are collapsed
7. Verify post-construction scan: for every entry whose `outputs` describe a returned object, confirm caller IPO entries exist and include `side_effects` for post-construction assignments
8. Spot-check 5 random entries by re-reading source files and verifying `first_statement`/`last_statement`
9. Fix any findings autonomously and re-audit from scratch until zero findings remain

`phases.P3_ipo_analysis: DONE` is set by PGR-3 as its final action — never set it directly.
